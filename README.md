# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users will need to register and login in order to create/view/update/delete their own urls. The web app will also allow users to visit the actual websites from the shortened urls they created.
